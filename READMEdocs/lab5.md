# Task

Create a Dart class Employee. Where each employee has id and a list of Sale. Create a separate class Sale each sale has record of the amount_earned against the employee id. e.g.

```dart
class Sale {
    int employee_id;
    double amount_earned;
    }
```

In main create a growable list of employee. Insert/add 5 employeeâ€™s data. Sort the list according to the amount_earned. In case of amount earned < 100 remove those employees.

# Code

```dart
// class Employee
// data member, id, type int
// data member, sale, type class Sale
// class Sale
// data member, amountEarned, type double
// data member, employeeID, type int

class Sale {
  int employeeID;
  double amountEarned;

  Sale({this.employeeID, this.amountEarned});

  @override
  String toString() {
    return ("{employeeID: $employeeID , amountEarned: $amountEarned }");
  }
}

class Employee {
  int employeeID;
  List<Sale> sale;

  Employee({this.employeeID, List<Sale> s}) {
    // copy constructor
    sale = new List<Sale>.from(s, growable: true);
  }

  double totalSale() {
    double totalSale = 0;
    sale.forEach((val) {
      totalSale += val.amountEarned;
    });
    return totalSale;
  }

  @override
  String toString() {
    return ("{ employeeID: $employeeID \n${sale.map((val) => '${val.toString()}\n').toString()}\n}");
  }
}

    new Sale(employeeID: 5, amountEarned: 5),
    new Sale(employeeID: 5, amountEarned: 60)
  ]);

  List<Employee> list = new List<Employee>()
    ..add(e1)
    ..add(e2)
    ..add(e3)
    ..add(e4)
    ..add(e5);
  print("Printing Eployees...");

    print("Total amount earned ${val.totalSale()}");
